Voltaire discusses the writers and artists who flourished under Louis XIV and claims that he could not discuss the l&#39;Abb&eacute; de Saint-Pierre because the Annales of l&#39;Abb&eacute; de Saint-Pierre were not printed until 1757. These Annals, Voltaire writes, are a satire of the government and the monarch who deserved more esteem and are not written well enough to forgive them their injustice. The family of l&#39;Abb&eacute; Saint-Pierre urged the author to conceal the work from the public and it was only printed after l&#39;Abb&eacute; Saint-Pierre&#39;s death. Voltaire therefore defends himself against the claims of l&#39;Abb&eacute; Sabatier who has claimed that Voltaire drew heavily on the Annals for his Si&egrave;cle. This passage concludes by Voltaire writing that l&#39;Abb&eacute; Sabatier came to Paris to work as a slanderer for money and it is therefore difficult to hope for paradise for him. It is even a great effort, Voltaire notes, to wish him this.</p>','Writer; Artist; l\'Abbé de Saint-Pierre; l\'Abbé Sabatier','History','Draft','<p>A piece of plain white paper upon which he has written some brief notes about the MS in red and blue ink has been included.

On 20 August 1648, the Prince of Cond&eacute; was victorious at Lens and the ten-year-old king pronounced that Parliament would be very angry. The parliamentarians complained about being called rebels. The Queen and Cardinal resolved to have three of the most stubborn magistrates kidnapped but the Cardinal decided to do this at noon rather than midnight which incited the public to riot.

All the brothers of Charles II, King of Spain, had died and Charles was weak and unhealthy. Louis XIV and Emperor Leopold of Austria had a treaty which decreed that Leopold would let Louis XIV take possession of Flanders on the condition that it would pass to the emperor upon the death of Charles II. Leopold regretted signing the treaty almost immediately and demanded that no court should know of it. No copies of the treaty were made and the only one in existence was placed in a metal cassette for which only Leopold and Louis XIV had keys. This cassette was given to the French ambassador in Vienna and Louis XIV sent sixteen of his bodyguards to accompany the courier in case the emperor changed his mind and tampered with the document whilst it was being transported. It was taken to Versailles.

Voltaire notes that it is one of the most fertile countries on earth and that it is very well located as it has many rivers, streams, and fountains. He proclaims that Barcelona is one of the beauties of Europe and that the country is designed to support the construction of ships. The mountains are filled with marble quarries, jasper ports, rock crystal, and many precious stones whilst the mines contain iron, tin, lead, alum, and vitriol. The eastern coast produces coral. Voltaire then turns to the people of Catalonia, claiming that they have not been made soft by abundance but rather have always been warriors. However, he notes, they have always been subjugated, having been conquered by the Romans, Goths, Vandals, and Saracens. Having shaken off the Saracens, Catalonia placed itself under the protection of Charlemagne. They then belonged to Aragon, and finally Austria under Philip IV. In 1640, they gave themselves to Louis XIII and retained their privileges but in 1652 returned to Austrian rule and sided with Archduke Charles against Philip V in the War of Succession.</p>','Catalonia; War of Succession; Philip IV; Philip V; Archduke Charles; Romans; Goths; Vandals; Saracens; Charlemagne; Aragon; Austria; Louis XIII','History','Draft','<p>A sheet of paper containing notes in an unknown modern hand about the manuscript in blue ink.</p>','<p>J.

The Duchess of Marlborough was persuaded that the Queen had brought her brother in secret to England, kissed him, and would have made him her successor despite his Roman Catholic religious views. Voltaire notes that it is claimed that on the eve of her death, Anne wrote several times: &lsquo;Ah! My brother, my dear brother!&rsquo; She died of apoplexy aged 49 on 12thAugust 1714 and both her followers and enemies agreed that she was a mediocre woman. However, Voltaire claims that there has been no glorious reign, no great captains on land or sea, no high ministers, and no eloquent speakers since those of Edward III and Henry V.

Voltaire writes that they are emigrants who prefer the religion of their country and who go elsewhere to seek misery or fortune, following the example of their fathers driven from France by the fatal insult done to Henry IV in the destruction of his law called the Edict of Nantes. He then turns to officers dissatisfied with the ministry, accused persons who have escaped rigorous forms of sometimes badly administered justice, and states that this is what happens in all of the countries of the earth.&nbsp;&nbsp;The second section of the text then considers wheat. The parliament of Paris, Voltaire notes, issued a disastrous decree which forbade merchants from contracting any association for this trade and all individuals from making a heap of grain. This discouraged farmers and Monsieur [Jean-Baptiste] Colbert had no option but to buy from foreign merchants at high prices. Voltaire notes that the people were fed but the cost to the State was high. The fear of scarcity prevented the export of wheat and some intendants also boasted of inhibiting trade with neighbouring provinces. In good years, grain could only be sold by petition to the council and labourers turned away from growing corn as they knew&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they could not expect a great profit from it. Voltaire claims that this was the only stain on Colbert&#39;s ministry. The issue was not rectified until 1764 when trade in grain was made free, with only a few restrictions, similar to those used in England.</p>','Religion; France; Henry IV; Edict of Nantes; Paris; Merchants; Trade; Grain; Jean-Baptiste Colbert; England','History','Notes','<p>A sheet of paper containing notes on the MS in an unknown modern hand, written in blue and red ink.</p>','<p>J.

The governor, garrison, and inhabitants fled, and the governor went inland to collect 300 cavalry and the surrounding militia. The English took the treasures they could find and transported them peacefully for three days. The slaves who had not fled helped to remove the wealth of their former masters. The governor was not bold or prudent enough to return to the city and either fight or form a treaty with the victors. The English then went to Panama and greatly advanced before Acapulco, taking great swathes of the centre of Spanish domination. The Spanish stalled Admiral Anson&#39;s forces with a larger fleet and artillery under the command of Don Joseph Pizarro, but the Spanish forces suffered from scurvy and hunger after provisions expected from Buenos Aires did not arrive. The commander eventually returned to Spain in 1746 with fewer than 100 of the 2,700 men he had left with. Pizarro&#39;s misfortunes, Voltaire writes, left Admiral Anson free in the South Sea, but Anson&#39;s forces too had suffered from scurvy. Anson therefore set his sights on taking a large Mexican galleon sent every year to Manilla, which Anson proceeded to use to sail for Africa.</p>','Louis XV; Stadtholder; Vienna; Marie-Thérèse; London; Congress of Breda; George II of England; Elizabeth Petranova, Empress of Russia; Livonia; Flanders; Maastricht; Nimegen','History','Draft',NULL,NULL,'Ink on paper','3 ff.','4o','270 x 182 mm','<p>P.5 is watermarked with text reading: &#39;I[heart]C VSSON BVILE&#39;.

Voltaire claims that he showed Mr. Paff and Mr. Crokius Dubius passages from chapter XXXIX of Ezekiel which he believed provided proof of Jewish people eating human flesh. Mr. Paff replied that the passage was only relevant to the birds whilst Mr Crokius Dubius conducted a long examination of the passage and concluded that it was merely figurative and not proof at all. Voltaire begs the men to consider that Ezekiel lived at the time of Cambyse who had in his army many Scythians and Tartars who commonly ate both men and horses, and to remember various tales about Jewish people cooking and eating their children. Again, Voltaire recounts that Mr. Paff and Mr. Crokius Dubius rejected his claims. He went on to tell them that the most polite of nations had been canibals, including the Egyptians, Chinese, Indians, and Greeks and added that when Samuel cut King Agag into pieces it was in order to cook him in a stew. Mr. Paff and Mr. Crokius Dubius returned that the Jews do not eat stew and Voltaire then countered this by suggesting that the Jews stewed goats, leading to a debate about the superiority of human flesh over the flesh of other animals. Voltaire then claims that the discussion was interrupted by a soldier who informed them that he had eaten Cossacks during the Siege of Kolberg (1760) and that the meat was not superior but rather tough.</p>','Jews; Seven Years’ War; Cannibalism; Antisemitism; Mr. Paff; Mr. Crokius Dubius; Siege of Kolberg','Letter (fictional)','Copy',NULL,NULL,'Ink on paper','4 ff.','4o','243 x 185 mm','<p>Pp.1-2 and 7-8 are watermarked with a circle containing two griffins topped with a crown.

Joly de Fleury asks not to speak of laws and customs because he lacks sufficient knowledge of them but concedes that it is necessary to discuss the reunion of territories and obtain the proper letters and patents. He says that he thinks it would be commendable to include in the preamble the memoirs and representations that have been produced for Burgey and Gex. Joly de Fleury writes then that he has attached a revised draft of the declaration and that he thinks it would be appropriate to unite the valley of Chezery with&nbsp;Nantua&nbsp;and Ballon with Seyssel.

Joly de Fleury claims that the Treaty will prevent smuggling, and this was evidenced to him when, a few days before his visit to Seyssel, they chastised an employee who boarded a boat. The remaining question, he notes, is whether the valley of Chezery should be united with Ballon [Ballon d&rsquo;Alsace] or the Pays de Gex, a matter which has already given rise to numerous memoirs.

He adds that his&nbsp;<em>La Trag&eacute;die de S&eacute;miramis</em>&nbsp;is moral and so he expects her protection.

[D.app.279] In this letter, Voltaire writes that a resident of Abbeville named Belleval lived intimately with L&#39;abbesse de Vignacour. Two young men arrived in Abbeville and the abbess received them at home and housed them in the convent as they were her cousins. The abbess preferred the younger of the two men, the Chever de la Barre, to Belleval and so he grew jealous and resolved to take revenge. Voltaire writes that Belleval knew that the Chever de La Barre had committed great indecency 4 months earlier and had been criticised for not removing his hat at a procession carrying the Blessed Sacrament, so he ran from house to house recounting these tales. He then went to all of the witnesses and threatened them, forcing the judge of to hear the case. The judge, however, discovered that Belleval&#39;s son had been the leader of the indecent acts with which the Chever de la Barre was involved. Belleval, Voltaire notes, made his son escape with Sr de Talonde and the son of the mayor of the city then had the Chever de la Barre followed by a spy, leading to his arrest. Voltaire notes that he was in Abbeville on business when de la Barre and an acomplice named Moisnel were escorted there from Paris, writing that there was great consternation in the city. In an &#39;Autre extrait&#39; appended to the tale, Voltaire writes that the accused were condemned by the Paris parliament to have their tongue and fist cut off, their heads cut off, and their body thrown into flames. This happened to the Chever de la Barre but a similar fate had not yet befallen Moisnel. Several lawyers signed a consultation proving the illegality of the judgement (of 25 judges, 15 opined death, and 10 opined light correction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(2) p.5-18: &#39;Ordre de la proc&eacute;dure dans le proc&egrave;s du chevalier de La Barre et autres accus&eacute;s&#39;.

Needham then discusses the instructions he gave Pigott&#39;s printer to regularly send sheets to Louvain as fast as they can be produced but says that work progresses slowly and will not be finished as soon as Pigott hopes, though Needham says that he will ensure that Pigott receives a dozen copies for his own private use. Needham then informs Pigott that he has paid Pigott&#39;s debt to Sir William Gordon, though Gordon refused to take the additional crown that Pigott had sent for Gordon&#39;s servants as he claimed that Pigott was only indebted to him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(5) A&nbsp;letter from Needham to Pigott. Needham begins by discussing the last winter, which he notes was severe but made comfortable by his investment in English flannel and being surrounded by fires, though he did have a slight cold at one stage. He notes that it was so severe a winter that his thermometer read frost at a height of 1ft 4&quot; above his fireplace. He goes on to note the thermometer readings of a variety of individuals, including the king. Needham says that there was more snow than the oldest man could remember ever seeing, leading to riots in Traineaus. He then mentions a &#39;strange affair&#39; that Pigott had been involved with, noting that he was glad it was now concluded. He follows this with a discussion of religion and crime, arguing that his view on the matter that he notes is contrary to that of Voltaire and &#39;the moderns&#39; because he believes that the crimes of an individual should not be attributed to their religion. Needham then discusses the affairs of mutual acquaintances before again turning to Voltaire. He writes that he is pleased with Pigott&#39;s account of Otaheite [Tahiti], remarking on Voltaire&#39;s tale of a German traveller at Lyons who quarrelled with his landlady and subsequently wrote in his journal that all the women of Lyon were cantankerous, and concluding that this is always the case when one judges a country by half a dozen villains. Needham wonders what Rousseau, &#39;the depreciator of civilised society&#39; would think of Pigott&#39;s account of Otaheite and New Zealand. The letter concludes with a discussion of experiments on sea water.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(6) A&nbsp;letter from Needham to Pigott. It begins with a brief discussion of astronomy before turning to Pigott&#39;s son Benjamin, whom Needham hopes to introduce to a Mrs and Miss Trafford on the voyage from Brussels to London. He continues with a discussion of the governance of the Society and the publications of their memoirs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(7) A&nbsp;letter from Sir Henry Charles Englefield, 7th Baronet to Nathaniel Pigott. Englefield notes that he has received the copy of Edward Pigott&#39;s work on the &#39;Well in Wales&#39; and has passed this on to the Astronomer Royal where it will be read in due course. He writes that he has also received Pigott&#39;s work and shall send this to the Astronomer Royal tomorrow, chastising Pigott for not having sent it sooner so that the two texts could have been sent together. He concludes by informing Pigott that his paper on double stars will be debated for publication the following day and that he is welcome to dine with Englefield whenever he wishes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(8) A&nbsp;letter from Sir Henry Charles Englefield, 7th Baronet to Nathaniel Pigott. Englefield thanks Pigott for his kind letter regarding Englefield&#39;s sister and apologises for his late reply, saying he had been both busy and lazy. He writes that the distracted state of public affairs has occupied his thoughts. Englefield briefly discusses William Herschel&#39;s telescope at Greenwich, before claiming that he did not know why the paper of Nathaniel&#39;s son, Edward, had not been published.</p>',NULL,'Letter',NULL,'<p>An extract from an auction catalogue with marginal notes in an unknown modern hand and a page from a book describing Voltaire&#39;s letter to Charles Augustin Feriol (D10256) on the back of which has been written &#39;Needham to Nathaniel Pigott, etc. etc&#39; are included.</p>',NULL,'Ink on paper','2 ff.; 2 ff.; 2 ff.; 2 ff.; 4 ff.; 2 ff.; 2 ff.; 2 ff.

Marbled paper has been added to the covers. The edges of the pages are gilded. A green ribbon to be used as a place marker is stuck inside the MS. There are remnants of wax in the left-hand margin of p.3, in the upper outer corners of p.6-7, the bottom of p.14 over the first word of the final line of text, in the inner margins of p.98-99, the inner margin of p.134, the inner margin of p.194, the upper right-hand corner of p.256, the bottom of p.336-37, the inner margin of p.372, between l.11 and 12 on p.385. Ink smudges and/or blots can be found on p.26-27, in the lower right-hand corner of p.77, the lower left-hand corner of f.108, the lower left-hand corner of p.210, the lower left-hand corner of p.212, the lower right-hand corner of p.217, the inner margin of p.214, the lower left-hand corner of p.228, on p.242-43, the lower right-hand corner of p.265, the lower right-hand corner of p.291, the top of p.355, the bottom of p.426, the lower half of p.427, the bottom of p.429. There is a faint grey-black stain on p.62-63. There is a partial ink fingerprint in the bottom right-hand corner of p.23, in the bottom right-hand corner of p.127, and in the upper left-hand margin of p.338. Two small indents between the antepenultimate and penultimate and penultimate and final lines of p.42-52 are faintly visible. The direction of the indents suggest that a small object had at one time rested between p.42 and p.43. The lower right-hand corner of p.107 has been folded over (since unfolded). The ink changes on p.115 to a darker ink. This change of ink also signifies the beginning of the most heavily edited sections of the manuscript. There are&nbsp;red&nbsp;marks throughout, including a letter &#39;A&#39; on p.175. There is a small hole in the middle of the lower half of p.173-74, the lower right-hand corner of p.278, the lower half of p.296, over the final line of p.373-74, the upper half of p.437-38. There is a faint stain running along the outer halves of p.176-77 and a small fleck of gold ink at the end of l.14 of p.177. There is also an area of discolouration along the inner margins of p.188-89. Some of the text on p.418-19 and 445 sparkles due to particles of drying sand being absorbed by the ink. There is an area of rectangular discolouration in the upper section of the inner margins of p. 397-403 suggesting that an object, perhaps a place marker, had been kept between these pages, likely between p.400-401 as this is where the discolouration is strongest. The pages have all been scored to create a neat border around the text.</p>','3','Words and phrases have been underlined throughout. Some faded letters have been drawn over in darker ink. The text has been ammended throughout via crossings out, and the addition of additional text superscript. Additional text has also been added to the titles and in the margins of the texts providing additional information about the contents and/or creation of the given text. Brackets and braces have been added in the margins. The text from p.115-20 is written both in darker ink and a portion of it is written in a smaller, less tidy script. A Table of Contents at the conclusion of the manuscript has been added in a messier hand than the rest of the manuscript. Small crosses, and occasionally other symbols, have been added in the margins in pencil by Theodore Besterman, along with minor comments on the text such as on p.132-33.

In a heated dispute, Triboulet said that he knows Marmontel as a villain because he wanted all men to love a God who is the father of all men. He said that Marmontel imagined on the word of St Ambrose that a young Valentinian who had not been baptised had nevertheless been saved and that they had the insolence to believe with St Jerome that several pagans lived holy lives, though he conceded that Marmontel had not gone so far as St John in one of his homilies. Triboulet noted that Marmontel even drew upon St Augustine without considering how many times he retracted his own opinions, suggesting that Marmontel and St Augustine thought that all humans who believed in God and lived piously according to his precepts would be saved by him. What was worse, Triboulet said, was that Marmontel had copied St Paul word for word in his Epistle to the Romans, and instructed him to learn his catechism. Triboulet then reasoned that there were 2 billion people on earth, and three generations per century, which equates to about 6 billion. Over 4000 years, that results in 240 billion damned people, from which only a few elected officials can be deducted. He counted Henry IV as one of the damned, whilst Ravaillac, purged by the sacrament of penance, enjoys eternal glory. Triboulet remarked that when the time came, he would have Marmontel cooked with Jean Hus, Jerome of Prague, Arnaud de Bresse, the counsellor of Bourg, and with all infamous people across the centuries who were not common sensical.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Voltaire then reflects on Triboulet&#39;s words, stating that Triboulet was a monk just out of license, and Marmontel was an academic of the first Academy of France. The words, Voltaire claims, were spoken in the home of a magistrate whom the licensee had come to in order to solicit for a trial in which he was accused of simony. Voltaire suggests that the words were spoken after both Triboulet and Marmontel had dined and drunk alcohol. In response to Triboulet, Marmontel asked forgiveness, stating that he was a man of the world that had not read the works of Triboulet&#39;s doctors. He stated that the mistakes of the men of the world were corrected by Triboulet and his graduates, but that he had not received the benefits of such correction and so asks that Triboulet be calm and forgive a poor ignorant man who had done evil without malice.Triboulet responded, calling all others in the room a band of rascals who do not stop preaching benevolence, gentleness, indulgence, and pushing wickedness to the point of wanting God to be good. He talks of Erasmus and claims that Le Vayer, tutor to Louis XIV, collected these blasphemies into a book. Triboulet lamented that they could burn neither Le Vayer nor the book as he was a councillor of state but argued that Marmontel could instead meet that fate as he was just an academic. The magistrate then intervened and asked for mercy for the culprit. Triboulet refused, saying that scripture forbade it. Marmontel hen asked for a pardon, and it was claimed that the whole Academy should be punished with him as they all thought alike. The magistrate again intervened and said that the Academy at large should not be punished, imploring Triboulet to respect the Academy and enable Marmontel to speak like a brave soldier and a good citizen. Triboulet left defeated. The magistrate then asked Marmontel if he did not admire Triboulet because a few days before Triboulet had entirely agreed with Marmontel, arguing that the monk had changed his mind because he was hurt by Marmontel&#39;s reputation. Marmontel spoke admirably of the tolerance established by the Empress of Russia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also transcribed in the MS is a copy of Voltaire&#39;s &#39;Au Roy de Dannemarck&#39;, a verse discussing conquerors and conquests.

It was variably attributed to La Beaumelle and Voltaire.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the letter, Voltaire writes that it has been three or four years since he last cried and he had hoped his old eyes no longer knew the weakness but, after Marie Louise Denis left him last, he wept as he was mourning her departure and her stay. Voltaire adds that the atrocity of what Denis has suffered is what upsets him, and questions whether a Lady of Paris (Denis), travelling with a passport of Frederick II, King of Prussia, could really have been dragged into the streets of Frankfurt by soldiers, and taken to prison without any trial, maid, or servants when her only crime was to travel two hundred leagues to convey a dying uncle to the Eaux de Plombi&egrave;res. He notes that is is sad for Frederick II to have not yet repaired the indignity committed in his name. Voltaire then turns to his own misfortune, saying that he had been arrested by Frederick II in order for him to get back his book of poems that he had left to Voltaire as a pledge of his goodness and a reward for Voltaire&#39;s care. He notes that he would have returned the volume if he had been asked and that it was not worth having an old man imprisoned for. He bemoans Frederick II&#39;s actions, writing of the many years of cordiality and friendship they had shared, and wondering how Frederick II can repair the damage done to Denis. Voltaire writes that he has sent back letters here for Madame Denis, noting that one from Madame de Fontaine was not consoling as it referred to Voltaire as Prussian, a claim he adamantly denies. He then acknowledges that some letters written against him have been erronously circulated under Frederick II&#39;s name, adding that Frederick II would not have written such letters as he is too aware of how to write properly given that he is King. He ends the letter by stating his wish to die in Denis&#39; arms, ignored by men and especially kings.</p>','Libel; Court; Prussia; Punishment; Frederick II; Madame Denis','Account; Letter','Copy (contemporary)',NULL,'<p>Theodore Besterman, &#39;Voltaire&#39;s Correspondence&#39;,&nbsp;<em>SVEC</em>&nbsp;23 (1957), no.4772.</p>','Ink on paper','16 ff.',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'1752-1753',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'https://search.nls.uk/permalink/f/mp49cm/44NLS_EAD13646_MS_5747',NULL),(74,'CVM135','Leabharlann Nàiseanta na h-Alba / National Library of Scotland, Edinburgh, UK','Acc.13647','Poems of Archibald McGilchrist Esq. of Northbar',NULL,'no',NULL,NULL,'English','<p>Poems on various subjects including the French Revolution, Edmund Burke, Voltaire, and Peter Pindar.</p>',NULL,'French Revolution; Edmund Burke; Peter Pindar','Poetry',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'c.1794',NULL,NULL,'<p>Presented to the National Library of Scotland by Mrs V.

Hamilton also reports the Stormonts told her of a conversation between the King and Queen and her uncle, Sir William Hamilton. The Queen asked Sir William if he intended to return alone to Naples and at last she confessed that she had been asked by the King to &#39;fish out&#39; if he intended to marry again. Sir William told the Queen that he had to be careful as to whom he could choose for a wife, to which the Queen responded that she believed that he held &#39;a bad opinion of Our Sex&#39;. He assured her that this was not the case and that he had had 22 happy years of marriage and was fearful that he might not be as happy a second time. The King then asked about Sir William&#39;s estate in Wales and who was to be his heir. The King supposed that it would be his nephew, Charles Greville, who was standing next to him at the time. Hamilton comments that Sir William answered &#39;this improper question very properly&#39;: he would &#39;certainly keep that secret to himself&#39;. Lord Stormont also told Hamilton that the Prince of Wales had made enquiries of her marriage and said many &#39;handsome things&#39; about her. On another occasion, at a party of the Bas Bleu, Eva Maria Garrick reported that Elizabeth Montagu had spoken &#39;handsomely&#39; of Hamilton and her forthcoming marriage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During a visit to Bulstrode, Hamilton describes spending her time cutting and pasting prints in Mary Delany&#39;s books of prints whilst conversing with her, and of decorating a box by pasting prints on to it. Mrs Delany gave her a gift of a locket made of mother-of-pearl which enclosed some of her hair. On the cover of the locket she had written a &#39;reward of industry&#39; and engraved around the locket was &#39;Win it &amp; wear it, M D aged 84&#39;. Mrs Delany told her that Lady Bute had asked if the reports were true that Hamilton was to be married. Lady Bute had said that Hamilton &#39;acted very wisely not to sacrifice my [Hamilton&#39;s] happiness by accepting offers w[hi]ch my heart &amp; mind were adverse to etc&#39;. Hamilton continues to note that her uncles Frederick and William Hamilton both seem happy with her choice of husband. &#39;I must own I think I have been very successful in making all the folks approve of what I like&#39;. Sir William was sure that she would be happy in her marriage, more so than if she married for &#39;ambition or interested motives&#39;. Although Hamilton wished to keep her engagement quiet amongst her friends for the moment, Charlotte Gunning informed her that she had been asked many questions at Court about the marriage, leaving Hamilton to have to &#39;submit in good humour to furnishing conversation to my acquaintances&#39;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hamilton writes of receiving many visits from her admirer Mr Stanhope (see HAM/2/9). Hamilton refused to see him but he left a message with her servant that he needed to see her before he left town. After Hamilton agreed to talk to him he told her that he had heard of her marriage and talked about how his &#39;heart &amp; soul felt&#39;. He talked of her &#39;many personal attractions&#39; but declared that &#39;to his taste I was possessed of every charm though certainly a plain woman&#39;. She writes that at one point during the meeting Anna Maria Clarke came into the room but mischievously ran straight out declaring that she would not &#39;interrupt a t&ecirc;te &aacute; t&ecirc;te&#39;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The diary includes details of a visit to Lord Mansfield&#39;s house at Kenwood and of Hamilton meeting the two Miss Murray&#39;s, Lady Stormont&#39;s sisters, who she notes have the title &#39;Miss&#39; but that both appear to be of an age to claim that of &#39;Mrs&#39;. Hamilton writes of the death of an acquaintance who left behind three children. She attends the christening of Lady Stormont&#39;s baby and describes the dinner she attended after it and lists the guests. She also writes of a visit to Horace Walpole&#39;s with her uncle, Sir William Hamilton. As Walpole had been disappointed at not seeing Sir William at Strawberry Hill that summer he told her &#39;he did not think he w[ou]ld let him in if he had not heard my name&#39;. They all then went to Mrs Garrick&#39;s who showed them many interesting things such as a pair of gloves that had belonged to Shakespeare. Hamilton includes sketches of a few of the things that Mrs Garrick showed her. She describes talking about&nbsp;Voltaire&nbsp;and art with Walpole. She discussed with her uncle people marrying merely for the sake of &#39;a rank or any eligible establishment without paying any regard to principles - dispositions, temper &amp;&#39;. Sir William argued that this was &#39;neither more or less than a&nbsp;<u>legal</u>&nbsp;prostitution&#39;. Her uncle also greatly pleased her by saying that he would give her a portrait of himself painted by Reynolds. She also writes that Mrs Garrick gave Hamilton the catalogue of her late husband&#39;s [David Garrick&#39;s] library at the Adelphi and invited her to chose any books from it she wished to read. (The following day she chose a few books and returned the catalogue to Mrs Garrick with a long note.) The diary also details a visit to see Lunardi&#39;s air balloon and of her seeing the kitten and dog that had &#39;accompanied Mr Lunardi in his Voyage&#39;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The diary also records that Hamilton suffered from an eye complaint and consulted Mr Churchill, the apothecary. Mrs Garrick gave her some &#39;famous eye water sold only by Mr Austin No. 17 Catherine Street, Strand&#39;. She notes her anxiety over her illness and over not being able to indulge in her &#39;favourite amusement of reading&#39; and of Anna Maria Clarke checking on her to ensure that she was not reading or writing. Hamilton discusses gossip such as My Vesey&#39;s Valet de Chambre &#39;having gone raving mad&#39; after receiving a letter from Ireland informing him of the infidelity of a woman whom he was in love with, and anecdotes including one about the Prince of Wales. Hamilton also writes of the excitement of her servants who came to inform her of air balloons being seen from the door of her house and one having a light which looked &#39;like a pretty meteor floated near Earth&#39;. Hamilton comments that they were only &#39;the three shilling ones let off by some person at the end of our street - there are dozens of them every night&#39;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hamilton also writes about Sir William Hamilton&#39;s return to Naples and her being too upset to say goodbye in person.</p>','Queen Charlotte; Margaret Cavendish Holles Harley Bentinck, Duchess of Portland; Sir William Hamilton; King George III of Great Britain; Mary Hamilton; Charles Francis Greville','Diary',NULL,NULL,NULL,'Ink on paper','58 ff.',NULL,'220 x 143 mm',NULL,'<p>The leaves are sewn or pinned into gatherings and loosely enclosed in a grey paper wrapper.
